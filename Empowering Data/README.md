# Empowering Data

## This is my Empowering Data Project

### Description
I completed this project during my time at the Girls Who Code Self-Paced Program in the data science track. This project explores the relationship between household size and the average number of years for female schooling in Colombia and Peru. The data used is from the "livwell135" database and the data used is from 2000 - 2015 and by analyzing this data, I was able to answer the following research question: How do geographical, social, and economic events impact a young womanâ€™s ability to continue in school?

### Instructions
To run this program, you will need to install the following Python libraries:
 - pandas
 - matplotlib.pyplot
In addition, be sure to run this program in the command prompt rather than using the Microsoft Visual Studio Code run button.
